if you have found this on your own. do not use it. this is completely unfinished and almost everything is currently broken.

Current issues:

- i completely fucked all of the commands while trying to get them all to be under "/mysticism".

- reloading the plugin is fine for getting new values but the bossbar doesn't disappear :0 and when i re-add more mysticism i get a second boss bar ;_;

- my commenting is all done by an AI and i have not actually looked at it at all i just got lazy and didnt want to describe everything
